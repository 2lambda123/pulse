Based on techniques outlined in ["Non-contact, automated cardiac pulse measurements using video imaging and blind source separation"](http://www.opticsinfobase.org/oe/abstract.cfm?uri=oe-18-10-10762) by Poh, et al (2010) and work by @thearn with OpenCV and Python ([webcam-pulse-detector](https://github.com/thearn/webcam-pulse-detector)).

TO DO:
===========
*Extract green channel from tracked forehead area
*Implement independent component analysis (ICA) on average green pixels over time
*Apply Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
*Extract heartrate
*Build web application
*optimize, optimize, optimize
